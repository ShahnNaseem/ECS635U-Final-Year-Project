# ECS635U-Final-Year-Project
This is my final year project. <br>

This is a brief overview of how to run my program. For a more comprehensive guide on how to run my program, please read the PDF file I uploaded for the Supporting Material Submission. I highly recommend following the ReadMe section in that document.

Reason for not having an executable file:
I do not have an executable file due to the nature of my project. Since my project is a location-based AR exergame, the content will not be able to be tested or viewed unless you are at the actual real-world location. In the context of my game, this is the QMUL Mile End campus. So, to let examiners and potential users test my game I am using the simulation mode that Lightship offers. This allows the game to be tested in the Unity game view without having to go to the QMUL Mile End campus. My report goes into a lot more detail about this simulation mode, more can be read here:
